## Who I am

I am a UI / UX designer and a programmer, my priority as a designer is to create digital solutions that are simple, beautiful and understandable, as a programmer my interest is in creating quality software with high technical performance.

I studied advertising graphic design at the Universidad de las Mercedes and at the Dar√≠as Institute, which was an experience of great professional growth, where I learned from excellent professionals. After learning traditional design, I dedicated myself to applying my knowledge to software-related products or services. Since I learned to program in Javascript my interest in programming has grown more and more every day and is linked to design, that is why I am constantly learning.
